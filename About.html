                <strong>Why GitHub Matters</strong>
            </p>
        </center>
        <p>
            GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and
            complete strangers. Over eight million people use GitHub to build amazing things
            together.<br />
            But at this moment, I want to share this idea with you, GitHub can help you to build
            your website including blog, in any style you like. If you are a developer, you
            can understand the way GitHub is a Web Server and you can publish your website into
            it. Then Everyone can visit the Web page you design. But if you are a non-developer,
            you must have used several kinds of blogs before. Your blogs have to obey the fixed
            format they have provided. What I should mention is that, there have another Blog
            platform called Blog Park, in Chinese BoKeYuan, supporting HTML content writing.

            But if we want to use big CSS or JS file, even write simple but long essays, it
            will be a horrible stuff. And then, GitHub comes to us and solve all of these problems.

            What a great thing is that, GitHub has released GitHub API for Java, .Net, PHP,
            JS. But I don't konw whether GitHub Java API supports Android. So, it will be my
            next FREETIME research.<br />
            Glad to share my idea with you, HAHA!
